title: Hello World! (Again, they made me do this)
---
<h1>Who am I?</h1>
My name is Valentin Martinez Huerta, I am 16 years of age and was born on August 4th, 2002. I am a junior in Franklin Delano Roosevelt High School. There's two types of categories in Roosevelt and that's the comprehensive side and collegiate side, I'm in the H-Tech Collegiate Early College side pursuing my Associates Degree.

To start off my life, Rodolfo my dads name and Valentina my moms name ended up having 7 kids including me. The order of kids from oldest to youngest is Miguel,Yesenia,Rodolfo,Virginia,Agustin,Me, and Monica. So far I'm enjoying my high school years, I also do extra curricular activities like soccer,band, and baseball. I mostly enjoy sports like baseball I'm playing on the Varsity Team, all of outfield and in band i play the trumpet. I'm a real sarcastic person but in a funny way not the rude type, whenever I'm in a uncomfortable situation I tend to act very awkward and make really bad corny jokes. Other than that I'm a very optimistic person and by that I mean exactly what I mean, I always try to find the bright side of things and other than that I see myself as a leader and a person that leads people into the correct path way.

<h2>What am I doing here?</h2>
Well basically, I started off in the regular side of the high school, but as I heard how good was the collegiate academy I decided to try out for it and it was honestly worth it. It gave a whole new perspective of things and what I wanted to do with my life. For Example, I did not have my life together at the end of middle school year but honestly who does? Another reason, why it's a benefit of being here is graduating with your Associates Degree. Not only will you be ahead of everybody else, but it gives way more opportunities and in jobs and interviews and looks good on your resume. I might not be the first one to graduate college/university in my family but I'm not gonna be the one to stop the cycle, I'm looking to be successful and not going to stop till I achieve it. In conclusion I'm doing this for my parents because they came here for us, for a better a life and the least I could do is repay them by getting a good education,being successful, and make them proud that all of that hard work they put in wasn't for nothing.

Make parents proud
Be successful
Good Education
<h3>Where will you take this experience?</h3>
Where will I take this experience? The easier question is where wouldn't I take it? Now in this type a world we're advancing more and more on technology. Soon this world will all be technology and that's inevitable, moral of the story is that it will be around for quite a long time. I personally took I.T because I'm always hearing how these people get paid around $2000 for a site when it only takes the person making it a couple of hours. I'm planning to continue I.T in college but obviously another major too, because it does take a lot of hard work and dedication to this type of work.

***I'm planning to go to colleges like***
1. UNT
2. TCU 
3. A&M

Those are just my top 3,but I'm planning to get a scholarship for maybe baseball or if I really try academics.
I've thought about designing video games but I'm not sure at the same time, not only that but also a lawyer, I want to go to law school and pursue a career of law. I'm personally thinking of an idea at the moment that could most likely change the world, because I get older I wanna be remembered as someone that did something major for this world and changed it in a matter of days,weeks,months,years.
