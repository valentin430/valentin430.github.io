Exit polls indicated Texas voters were relatively split about what they think the most important problem is facing the country. Over a third of voters said health care was the most important problem. Two-thirds of those voters went for O'Rourke.

Of the third of voters who believe that immigration is the most important problem, about three-quarters supported Cruz. Almost a quarter of voters thinks the economy is the country's biggest problem, and among them, the majority voted for Cruz.

Twenty-two percent of voters in Texas were voting in a midterm for the very first time. These voters leaned towards O'Rourke by 7 points, while return voters favored Cruz by 6 points.

Young voters overwhelmingly supported O'Rourke, 71 to 29 percent. Voters aged 30-44 leaned towards him 51 to 47. Voters over 45 favored Cruz 58 to 41.
